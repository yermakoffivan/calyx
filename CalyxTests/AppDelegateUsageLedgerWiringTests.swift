//
//  AppDelegateUsageLedgerWiringTests.swift
//  CalyxTests
//
//  Pins AppDelegate.startUsageLedger(server:ledger:), the one place the
//  usage ledger is connected to the app. It installs the server's usage
//  bridge, so a `usage_report` call through /mcp reads that ledger,
//  answers "tracking is off" exactly while the ledger's own switch is
//  off, and resolves `session_id: "current"` through the registry the
//  server holds at call time.
//
//  An export posted to the usage route is the one source of a publish:
//  the route hands it to the GIVEN ledger, whose publish carries the
//  session's totals. An accepted hook event reads and publishes nothing.
//  The startup catch-up settles the sessions the store already heard, at
//  a priority no higher than utility.
//
//  The whole path is driven for real: authenticated requests are routed
//  by a test server into a test ledger over a store in a per-test
//  temporary directory. The shared server, the shared ledger, ~/.claude
//  and Application Support are never involved, and the usage setting is
//  pointed at a test suite so that a wiring mistake reaching the shared
//  ledger would find tracking off.
//
//  R3b: it also installs the usage route's endpoint on that server
//  (`server.usageIngest`), forwarding exports to `ledger.ingestExport`,
//  accepting the credential held by the holder it is given, and noting
//  every verdict in the monitor it is given; it loads that credential
//  from the directory it is given (a per-test directory here, never
//  Application Support), syncs the tracking flag, and starts a catch-up.
//
//  R4b: `startUsageLedger` no longer loads the credential or syncs the
//  tracking flag itself: its startup task awaits ONE reconcile of the
//  telemetry activation it is given (which does both), then catches up.
//  It also requests a reconcile on every `.calyxIPCStateDidChange`.
//  Every test here gives it a per-test activation (never `.shared`):
//  inputs "tracking as the ledger says, IPC on, server not running", so
//  the target is `.untouched` (sync, load creating) with tracking on and
//  `.removed` (fake remove, sync, load without creating) with tracking
//  off, which is what the startup did before R4b; its effects reach this
//  test's ledger and holder and never a settings file.
//
//  R5b: the bridge it installs answers `usage_report` from
//  `ledger.tokenReports`: a fixture export posted to the usage route
//  appears in the tool's rows and totals.
//
//  WAITING. A test waits for a publish that must happen through an
//  expectation (bound: UsageWiringFixture.waitSeconds, reached only on
//  failure). Before asserting what was or was not published it calls
//  `settle`, which closes the ledger behind every task started so far
//  (`close()` waits for settles and pending publishes).
